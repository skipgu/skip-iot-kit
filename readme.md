By participating in this initiative, you **agree** with the following
[**GUIDELINES**](TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md). **Read the guidelines carefully before 
applying for the IoT Kit**. The quantity limit is **three items** per person

## What are the available boards, sensors, and kits?

Please visit the [**SKIP IoT Kit**](https://skipgu.org/skip-iot-kit/) page to

### Didn't find what you were looking for?

Ouch, that's a bummer! However, there's still hope. We have a **large
collection** of unsorted items that are not listed on the website (primarily
due to the lack of time). Please contact us and we'll see what we can do to
assist you. Don't hesitate to ask for **advice** or **recommendations**.

something, don't hesitate to **contact us**. By the way, the application
is **free**, **non-binding**, and takes less than a minute to fill out.
